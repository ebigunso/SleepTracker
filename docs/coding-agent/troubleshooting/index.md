# Troubleshooting (Repo-Specific)

This directory is for repo-specific troubleshooting notes that are discovered over time.
Keep entries short, actionable, and reproducible.

If a troubleshooting pattern is cross-repo and durable, stage it for global migration via:
- rules placeholders (Global Migration Candidates), and/or
- a skill candidate draft (repo-local staging)

## Common categories (add as needed)

- Install / dependency issues
- Dev server startup / ports
- CI-only failures (differences from local)
