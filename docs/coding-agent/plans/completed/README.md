# Completed Plans

Move finished and validated execution plans here.

Completed plans are a useful audit trail:
- what was done
- what decisions changed mid-flight
- what validations were run
- what risks/assumptions existed

Keep completed plans readable:
- prefer short progress/decision logs
- avoid dumping raw command output into the plan (link to artifacts if needed)
