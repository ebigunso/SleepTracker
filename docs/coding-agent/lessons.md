# Lessons Log (Coding Agent)

Purpose:
- Capture recurring mistakes and their prevention mechanisms.
- Reduce repeated failures by turning “corrections” into durable guardrails.

## How to use
- Append a new entry after any user correction or significant miss (validation skipped, review miss, scope drift, tooling failure).
- Keep entries short and actionable.
- Promote repeated/high-severity lessons into repo rules or skill drafts.

## Tags (recommended)

- validation
- delegation
- review
- ui-e2e
